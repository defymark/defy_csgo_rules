    Opinionated Games: These are games that kills prisoners based on the guards opinion. Warden must type “!refuse” before starting an opinionated game. Majority decides whether or not the warden can proceed with the opinionated game or not. Other games may be created, but here are a few of the most popular.
    Joke Day: Prisoners take turns telling jokes, each time the guards will vote whether they like it or not, when a prisoner's joke loses he dies.
    Singing/Dancing/Diving Contest: Like a joke day but each prisoner is chosen to sing, dance, dive or perform another talent.
    Shoot or Don’t Shoot: All prisoner(s) line up on a line set by the warden, All prisoner(s) must face away from the warden and freeze. The warden will then ask prisoner(s) at random shoot or don’t shoot, while his crosshair is on a random prisoner(s) head. If the prisoner asked says shoot then the T that he is aiming at will die, and if he says don’t shoot then the game goes on and the warden picks new prisoner. prisoner(s) can only say don’t shoot 2 times in a row, then they must say shoot.
    Custom Games: All custom games are considered opinionated and must be voted on.
    Elimination Games: These games are mostly skill based, and are generally just used to thin the herd. Here are the most common ones:
    Simon Says:
    To begin playing Simon says, Simon must say "Simon says I am Simon, Simon says we are now playing Simon says."
    Prisoners must only do the order that Simon says until the next Simon Says order is given.
    Prisoner's must not do any actions that Simon did not issue.
    Warden CANNOT begin playing Simon says at the beginning of the round. Simon Says can only begin once prisoners are at a prisoner designated area.
    Do the Simon says order once then stop unless instructed otherwise by Simon.
    For example, if Simon says crouch you must un-crouch after 2-3 seconds.
    First Reaction Last Reaction: Warden will say first reaction or last reaction and then an action…
    First Reaction: First person to complete the action dies.
    Last Reaction: Last person to complete the action dies.
     Colors: All prisoner(s) line up on a line set by the warden and take turns saying color names.
    The T's have 5 seconds to say a color that has not been said or they are KOS.
    Death Walk: All prisoner(s) line up on a line set by the warden, All prisoner(s) must look straight up with their flashlights turned on (Type /flashlight), Looking down is KOS. When the warden indicates to begin the prisoner(s) will crouch walk backwards until they fall off of a ledge, or when they feel that they are at the edge they stop, stand up and freeze while still looking up
    Red Light Green Light: All prisoner(s) line up on a line set by the warden, there is a finish line further away from them. When the warden says green light all prisoner(s) are then allowed to move forward, but once the warden says red light all prisoner(s) must stop. If a prisoner doesn’t stop in time then the warden is allowed to kill the prisoner. The game goes on until the set amount of winners is reached.
    Odd Man Out: Can only be played if there are 3 prisoner(s) remaining, the prisoner(s) form a triangle (On positions set by the warden). The warden will tell the prisoner(s) to face away from their teammates, and when the wardens says to the prisoner(s) will turn around and look at one of their teammates. Whoever has 2 prisoner(s) facing them is the odd man out and is KOS.
    Kill Random Days: This the most efficient way to kill prisoners, and can even be used to kill rebelling prisoners. The warden will herd all non rebelling prisoners into an area and use the !kr command to randomly kill prisoners until he has the desired number of players. If the player did not die by !kr then he survives that option does not kill it just randomly selects a player. This game may only be played with 4 or less prisoners alive.
    Map Games: These are any of the games built into the map. For example: colors, jump rope, strafe jump, climb, etc. Games in this category may be played back to back as many times as the warden would like as long as you change games with the next round.
    Event Days/Special Days
    Event Days: These are days that allow prisoners to free roam and do whatever they want with a few restrictions, and are mostly just for fun. Once an event day is started, it does not end until the round is over, even if they warden says it’s over. You may not extend on event days. Many of the event days can be triggered by voting for them via the player menu (!menu) but the most common 2 are:

     War Day: The goal is have the prisoners and guards fight to the death. Prisoners must be actively pursuing the guards at all times. This event day can be played 2 ways:
        Restricted war days:
            A room or area of the map is chosen, and all guards must go to this area of the map. They may not leave that area until the war day has reached the expansion phase. The expansion time is set by the warden.
            Guards are allowed to camp, prisoners must get weapons and pursue the guards. 
        Normal war days:
            The prisoners must be given 30 seconds, which starts when the cell doors open, to break into armory and get guns. During this 30 seconds the guards will try to run as far as they can, because when the 30 seconds is up prisoners and guards may start fighting. Both prisoners and guards cannot shoot anyone during this 30 second grace period.
            Guards are not allowed to camp.
 
     Freeday: These are days where the prisoners may do whatever they want without rebelling, if they rebel, then they may be shot. The last prisoner may have a last request if they wish, but cannot be forced to have an LR. It is automatically a freeday if:
          Cells open before orders are given.
          Warden does not give orders within the first minute of the round.
          Warden dies and no guard takes over within 15 seconds.
 
      Zombie Freeday:
          Zombies must walk and may only right click Knife a guard.
          Zombies can only climb objects/ladders to get to a guard.
          Guard may not kill a zombie that right click knifes them.
          Guard may not restrict areas.

TTT EXPLANATIONS

Description
    TTT is a Role playing game mode with 3 roles, Detective, Innocent, and Traitor. The point of the game is a full-on battle between the Detectives and Innocents vs Traitors. The Traitor(s), with the help of their Traitor Buddies (T-buddies) have to kill the Detectives first and then all Innocents. While the Detectives and Innocents have to figure out who the Traitors among them are and kill them.
    Note: 7 players = 1 Detective and 1 Detective = 2 Traitors. You may have more than one detective or traitor at a time.

Roles
    Innocent: Find the traitors among you and kill them.
    Detective: Assist the Innocents to figure out who the traitor(s) among the group are.
    Traitor: Kill all Innocents and Detectives without getting caught to win the round.

Traitorous Acts
    Shooting towards players (traitor baiting)
    Throwing an incendiary, molotov, or HE grenade towards players.
    Not identifying bodies which are in close proximity and could reasonably be acknowledged.
    Using any traitor weapon/item.
    Entering/Leaving a traitor only area (traitor rooms)
    Not following detective's orders
    Damaging health stations/traitor testers or moving health stations to where they cannot be used or retrieved
    Prop Pushing (Innos will be slayed for prop pushing)
    Damaging another player with an explosive prop.

    Look at the KOS section below to see what you can KOS someone for. When you see someone do a Traitorous act you should call SUS on them if you cannot KOS them for that.
    *If you see someone commit a traitorous act you must call KOS or kill them within 30 seconds, otherwise you may only sus them.

RDM
    RDM stands for Random Deathmatch. RDM is when you damage or kill any player while being an innocent or detective without a valid reason. If you kill someone in crossfire it is not RDM.
    Note: Admins will make the final decision on whether a given scenario is RDM or not. RDM will result in two round slays per RDM or 4 slays for revenge RDM. Mass RDM, which is rdming 3 or more players in a round, will result in a ban.

Karma
    Karma is a reputation system. If you kill someone who you aren’t supposed to, then you may lose karma. Everyone starts off at 90 karma,  you have a max of 100, and if you reach 50 or below, then you will automatically be banned for 1 week. Karma rewards and deductions are given for these actions:
        Killing a traitor as an innocent: +4 karma
        Killing an innocent as an innocent: -13 karma
        Killing a detective as an innocent: -15 karma
        Killing an innocent as a traitor: +1 karma
        Killing a traitor as a traitor: -10 karma
        Killing a detective as a traitor: +3 karma
        Killing an innocent as a detective: -7 karma
        Killing a detective as a detective: -15 karma
        Killing a traitor as a detective: +4 karma

KOS
    KOS stands for kill on sight, it is the act of damaging or killing someone as soon as you see them. If you call a KOS then you must be prepared and willing to kill that player otherwise it is a false KOS. If someone said, "KOS Hoodini!" then you can kill Hoodini if you see him. You do not need to call a KOS before killing a player, however it is encouraged to call a KOS so that others can be alerted in the event that you fail to kill the suspected Traitor. When you call a KOS you must explain why you are calling a KOS if you are not in danger or in direct contact with the suspected Traitor. Otherwise you must explain why the KOS was called afterwards. You should only KOS or Call a KOS on someone if you are certain they have done something below which warrants a KOS or have seen them do at least two Traitorous Acts. If you see a traitorous/kosable act you must call KOS or kill them within 30 seconds.
When can you kill on sight?
    Someone called a KOS on them.
    They shot towards you or another player.
    They killed an innocent. (When you see someone kill another player, wait/ask them to ID the body first. They may have just killed a Traitor. If they don't ID the body they are likely a Traitor and you can kill them.)
    The detective has given a reasonable order and the player has failed to comply after 3 warnings.
    They are entering or leaving a Traitor only area (Traitor Rooms)
    They are using a Traitor weapon/ability. Example: C4, Hurt Station, Turret, One hit knife secret, flamethrower, Heavy, any other item found exclusively in T rooms, etc.
    They are standing next to and see someone who is shooting or kosed and they are not killing them.
    You have seen a player do a Traitorous Act. (In some cases when you are not in direct danger it may be better to SUS for a Traitorous act.)

SUS (Suspicion)
    SUS and HIGH SUS both mean the same thing. Suspicion is called when you see a player do something that is borderline traitorous or can reasonably connect them to a traitorous act, but you do not have enough proof to kill them or call a KOS. Suspicion does not mean KOS at 2:00 (overtime) unless you have obtained more information that proves that the player is a Traitor. Calling Suspicion without seeing a player do anything that would be considered traitorous behavior, just to kill them at 2:00 is considered RDM, even if that player ends up being a traitor. When you call sus it must be accompanied by a valid reason, otherwise it is invalid.

Live Checks
    When someone calls a "Live Check", if you are innocent you should respond. Otherwise you may be sus. You can only call live checks during overtime.

Overtime
    Overtime begins when there is less than 2 minutes remaining in the round. During overtime you may kill players for suspicion, only if you are positive that they are the Traitor. Remember, your karma is affected if you kill an innocent. In order to kill a player for suspicion you must be prepared to explain why you are suspicious of that player if asked. Explaining suspicion during the round will allow other players to decide whether or not they want to kill that player in overtime.

Misc
    Type /menu to purchase items from the Traitor Shop
    Taser does not kill players, it identifies them.
    If someone activates the jihad you may kill them only if you are sure they activated it.
    If someone is shooting through a wall you may shoot back, but only if you’re certain that there is only one person in that room, except t-rooms which only t’s should be inside.
    Verbal t baiting, saying things like "I'm the traitor" is not kosable.
        Players may sus and kill you in overtime for verbal t bait.

    1st Ban = 3 day(4320) | 2nd Ban = 1 week(10080) | 3rd Ban = 2 weeks(20160) | 4th Ban 1 Month (43200) | 5th Ban = Perma Ban

Warns
    If an admin determines a rule has been broken they will first check your previous warns. If you do not have a warning on record for that specific rule violation you will be punished according to number 1 of that rule. For example if you look at rule 9. Exploiting (Punishments(s): 1. Warn + Slay 2. Ban)  the first offence would be a Warning + Slay. If this rule is broken again in the future you will immediately be punished according to number 2 listed under punishments of that rule, in the case of rule #9 Exploiting this would mean you would receive a ban the next time you broke that rule.
